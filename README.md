- 👋 Hi, I’m @AEv3M
- 👀 I’m interested in switching careers to tech.  I'm reasonbly fluent in python and C++, but I'm down to learn anything.
    I've also been getting really into pentesting lately (ie. HTB, THM, etc)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Github, CodeTriage, and how to contribute to open source projects.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything that anyone needs help with that will help me learn and teach.
- 📫 How to reach me A_Ev3_M@protonmail.com
